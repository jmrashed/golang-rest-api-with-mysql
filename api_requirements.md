# API Requirements and Scope

This document outlines the initial requirements and scope for the Go REST API, focusing on the features and functionalities to be implemented.

## 1. Core API Functionality

### Endpoints
- **User Management:**
    - `POST /register`: Register a new user.
    - `POST /login`: Authenticate a user and return an authentication token.
    - `POST /refresh-token`: Refresh an expired authentication token.
    - `GET /users/{id}`: Retrieve user details by ID (requires authentication and authorization).
    - `PUT /users/{id}`: Update user details by ID (requires authentication and authorization).
    - `DELETE /users/{id}`: Delete a user by ID (requires authentication and authorization).
- **Resource Management (Example - assuming a 'Product' resource):**
    - `GET /products`: Retrieve a list of products (with optional pagination, filtering, sorting).
    - `GET /products/{id}`: Retrieve a single product by ID.
    - `POST /products`: Create a new product (requires authentication and authorization).
    - `PUT /products/{id}`: Update an existing product by ID (requires authentication and authorization).
    - `DELETE /products/{id}`: Delete a product by ID (requires authentication and authorization).

### Data Models
- **User:**
    - `ID` (UUID/int)
    - `Username` (string, unique)
    - `Email` (string, unique, validated)
    - `PasswordHash` (string)
    - `Role` (string, e.g., "admin", "user")
    - `CreatedAt` (timestamp)
    - `UpdatedAt` (timestamp)
- **Product (Example):**
    - `ID` (UUID/int)
    - `Name` (string)
    - `Description` (string)
    - `Price` (float)
    - `Stock` (int)
    - `CreatedAt` (timestamp)
    - `UpdatedAt` (timestamp)

### Expected Behavior
- **Authentication:**
    - Users must register with a unique username and email.
    - Passwords will be securely hashed.
    - Successful login returns a JWT token.
    - Token refresh mechanism for extended sessions.
- **Authorization:**
    - Role-based access control (RBAC) will be implemented.
    - Specific endpoints will require certain roles (e.g., only "admin" can create/update/delete products).
- **Validation:**
    - All incoming request payloads will be validated against defined schemas.
    - Clear error messages for validation failures.
- **Error Handling:**
    - Consistent JSON error responses with appropriate HTTP status codes.
    - Centralized error handling mechanism.
- **Logging:**
    - Log incoming requests, outgoing responses, and any errors.
    - Structured logging for easier analysis.
- **Database:**
    - MySQL will be used as the primary database.
    - `dbOp` package will handle database interactions.

## 2. Future Considerations (Out of Scope for Initial Implementation)
- Password reset functionality.
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA).
- More granular permission system beyond basic roles.
- Advanced caching strategies (e.g., Redis).
- WebSocket support for real-time updates.
